                <h3>Cold Brew</h3>
                <p>Coffee that's brewed with cold water over an <br/>
                    extended period, typically 12-24 hours.<br/> It results in a smoother,  
                     less acidic coffee we<br/>serve over ice.</p>
                     <h4>Price: £4.00</h4>

                <h3>Espresso</h3>
                <p>A concentrated coffee brewed by forcing a <br/>
                   small amount of nearly boiling water through <br/>
                   finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso is <br/>
                   known for its bold, rich flavor and is the <br/>
                   base for many coffee drinks.</p>

                <h3>Iced Coffee</h3>
                <p>A refreshing coffee beverage that is served <br/>
                    cold over ice. It's a delightful and cooling <br/>
                    alternative to hot coffee, particularly <br/>
                    during warm weather. </p>

                <p> Coffee made with a shot of espresso and a<br/>
                    larger amount of steamed milk, typically<br/>
                    topped with a small amount of milk foam.<br/>
                    Lattes are creamy and have a milder <br/>
                    coffee flavor.</p>
